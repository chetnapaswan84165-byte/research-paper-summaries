# Write a short imaginative paragraph about a future genetics breakthrough
According to me in future genetics will become so easy to understand and we get to know even more details about genetics. We will going to study in depth.
Development in technology / biotechnology leads these changes in future and make the things more better. 
I think In fuutre we can able to get to know the codons or polypetide more in details. We can easily find about which polypeptide codes for their respective functions of cause any disease if get it contact with other codon /polypettide.
In future we can able to treat every disease on genetics level, even we can alter any codon to get different output. 
Such as If a codon/polypetide after translation form amino acid which function or play a role in human brain to do this work anyhow. Like this production of a specific amino acid
effect the human brain by realesing a specific hormone in body and because of this hormone human brain perform those actions which should not to be performed. 
If I say truly about my vision or what I want to go in genetics is that I want to get to know which codon/polypetide form amino acid which 
then help in secreting oxytocin in female, then I make sure that these amino acids could release oxytocin in control amount so that body should have to be in limits or in control. 
They don't get influence by this hormone and done any kind of activity whcih latter they cause any complications.
I also get to know about I read a article in which a scientist found a gene or DNA which code for AIDS disease and by altering this DNA that scientist able to precaution or make the body safe that this disease never going to have in future. 
If we can successfuly alter the specific DNA for any particular thing to treat any issue before it happen in body. This will going to a biggest milestone achieve in genetics and also in the industry of biotechnology.

# Why I chose it
I choose it because I alredy have my imagination in this topic. I want this future of genetics. I know it will happene in future. 
I choose it becasue I know genetics will going to be so depth. We have so many things left to learn about DNA/gene/genetics.

# What you learned
I learn that what I truly want to do in genetics, waht kind of research I need to perform in genetics to get the output I want.
I alredy have an idea about what I will do on the genetics level.
