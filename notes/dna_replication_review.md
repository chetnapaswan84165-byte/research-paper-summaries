# DNA Replication Review

# Paper Title: <Processing of DNA Topoisomerase II-DNA-Protein Crosslinks Associated with Anticancer Drugs>
Main Points:
1. During the process of cell divisio and gene expression the DNA structure unwinds, thereby generating torisonal stress. 
2. DNA topoisomerase is an enzyme that relieves this stress. 
3. Topoisomerase form temporary covalent bond with phophate backbone of DNA, due to this DNA strands breaks and relieving torsional stress.
4. Torisonal stress during replication or transcription is also relievedd by topoisomerase I(TOP1) and II(TOP2).
5.  Some anticancer drugs targeting Topoisomerase, knows as topoisomerase poisons, trap the topoisomerase reaction intermediates and cause DNA strand breaks bearing topoosomerase-DNA-protein crosslinks(TOP-DPCs).
6.  TOP1 Poison such as camptothecin and TOP2 poison etoposide.

 # Questions 
 From what these topoisomerase form what are the molecules form it? 
 How they get to know about this torisonal stress?
 How this topoisomerase poison works as anticancer drug?
