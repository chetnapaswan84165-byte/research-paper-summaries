# One Disease linked to DNA mutation
Sickel Cell Anemia 
This disease casued due to point mutation in DNA sequence. A change in frameshit reading by adding a single base pair of nuclotide in beta globin chain. 
This lead to the formation of glutamine instead of valine during the formation of amino acid. The presence of valine in the beta globin chain 
lead to change in the shape of red blood cells. And Glutamine chages the shape from spherical(concave) to disc like shape. Change in shape make the blood flow or RBCs flow in blood vessels difficult. 
Due to insufficient reach of blood in the body makes the body suffer from potential organ damage and chronic pain and incread risk of infection in the body.

# One Question a genetic researcher might ask about it 
A biggest question a genetic researcher could ask about this disease is that "can we cure this disease through gene therapy"?
Or it could be another question is can we do mutation in the dna sequence of artries or veins so that it can change its shape which favourable for the changed shape of red blood cells due to sickel cell anemia. 
Basically due to the change in arteries and veins shape could become favourable for the disc shaped red blood cell. And this change will not going to affect the bood flow and it will not going to cause any harm in the body by chaging the shape of artries and veins. 
We can proced this mutation if it could not complicate or affect other functions of body.
** This question leads a new question in my mind could this change create more complication like it make difficult for heart function.**

# One dataset that could help answer it 
Dataset that can help answer my question or genetic researcher question is that if we have a experimentally dataset of mutation in different body parts, what kind of mutation, how this mutation happened, waht changes it face and every minute in depth deatiled dataset about mutation.
Help us to perform experiment on the computer. 
So, Having a accurate dataset about differenr types of diseaase caused due to Mutation, how it caused, waht effect it had, with every minute details in depth, helps a lot to genetic researcher.
